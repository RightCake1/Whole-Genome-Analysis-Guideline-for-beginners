Welcome to the **Bacterial Whole Genome Analysis Guideline for Beginners**! This repository serves as a comprehensive starting point for researchers interested in bacterial genome analysis, focusing on tools and techniques for comparative genomics and metagenomics.

## 📚 Overview
This guideline is designed for dry lab (computational) analysis of bacterial genomes. It covers:

- **Comparative Genomics:** Tools and techniques to analyze and compare multiple bacterial genomes.  
- **Functional Annotation:** Identification of genes, AMR genes, plasmids, virulence factors, and mobile elements.  
- **Visualization:** Generating phylogenetic trees, heatmaps, and pangenome plots.  
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Simplified explanations and practical tips for getting started with minimal prior experience.

## 🎯 Features
- **Comparative Genomics:** Step-by-step instructions for analyzing and comparing bacterial genomes.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Simplified explanations and practical tips to get you started.
